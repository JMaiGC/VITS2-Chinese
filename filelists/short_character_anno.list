./custom_character_voice/character/processed_0.wav|稻妻神里流太刀术皆传神里绫华参上
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_1.wav|請多指教啊
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_2.wav|這樣悠閒安穩的時光,如果再多一點就好了。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_3.wav|我真貪心啊
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_4.wav|就和茶一样,细细品味,才能理解其中风雅。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_5.wav|就是旅行者平日里的生活吗?
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_6.wav|感覺又多瞭解了你一些。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_7.wav|剑抱业名工懷寶
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_8.wav|随我一同避雨吧
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_9.wav|所大人,是在訴說什麼嗎?
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_10.wav|寂银妆素,桔高映琼枝。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_11.wav|嗯……美景当前,只差一壶茶与之相衬呢。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_12.wav|要去哪邊走走嗎?
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_13.wav|眼睛,向著風吹來的方向
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_14.wav|怎么样,很舒服吧
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_15.wav|旅行者
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_16.wav|這樣在清晨見你一面,我會忍不住覺得,接下來將是順利的一天。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_18.wav|茶饭之后,难免略有困倦是否有兴致下盘棋提神呢?
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_19.wav|晚上好
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_20.wav|会是一个良宵呢
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_21.wav|知是梦 何须醒
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_22.wav|不比真如,一相會。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_23.wav|稻妻幕府社奉行神里家,位於稻妻名門中的筆頭之格位。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_24.wav|作为三奉行之一,掌管祭祀活动与人文艺术
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_25.wav|双亲过世之后,族内的大小事务便由兄长和我承担了。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_26.wav|多人因為我是白鷺公主,是社奉行神里家的大小姐,而敬重我。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_27.wav|他们所敬重的,只是我所身处的地位,与绫华我是怎样的人并无关系。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_28.wav|我想,能真正走进我的,或许只有,如今的我
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_29.wav|依舊想成為值得大家信任的人
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_30.wav|鼓舞我的原因,已不再是肩上的責任,或他人的期待。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_31.wav|是因為……你也是這樣的人啊
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_32.wav|如你有空,我們移步木漏茶室如何?
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_33.wav|在这样恬静的日子,略加交流茶艺心得,想来是颇具雅趣的。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_34.wav|如果有机会的话,我想试着和你共度异国的节日。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_35.wav|遵循的当地风俗、礼仪规范,还有伴手礼的推荐
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_36.wav|可以麻烦你…一一指导我吗?
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_37.wav|神之眼,即是胸怀大志之人所获的印绶
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_38.wav|如果問我有什麼志向的話
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_39.wav|这个还是保密吧
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_40.wav|只是一个微不足道的梦想罢了
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_41.wav|常说 禅茶一味
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_42.wav|剑禅一如
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_43.wav|那么剑和茶,又是什么关系呢?
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_44.wav|你在城中,見過枯萎的櫻花樹嗎?
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_45.wav|枯之美 讓我想到春天盛開之景
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_46.wav|不过,别人似乎并不这么想
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_47.wav|開花的樱树會被移走
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_48.wav|就算一次也好,真想看到它再次開放。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_49.wav|是我很重要的朋友
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_50.wav|开朗和阳光,总是感染着我
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_51.wav|意义上来说,他就像是我的另一个兄长一样。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_52.wav|成為了神里家的一員
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_53.wav|领奉行工作的九条裟罗,他总是一脸严肃
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_54.wav|她曾经起过几次争端
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_55.wav|她本质是忠义之士,这点无可否认
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_56.wav|鹿野院先生
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_57.wav|她和九条小姐一样,是天领奉行的人。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_58.wav|她……也是一个很有原则的人。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_59.wav|这些原则的坚持,甚至比九条小姐更执着。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_60.wav|不过,什么事应该被算在这些原则之内……我想,或许只有鹿野院先生自己知道吧。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_61.wav|早柚这孩子,最近有沒有給你添什麼麻煩呢?
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_62.wav|如果看見他偷懶,可以直接告訴我。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_63.wav|大御所大人的看法嗎?
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_64.wav|不該由我等下屬隨意議論
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_65.wav|但,將軍大人他在追求永恆之路上,可能也很孤獨吧。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_66.wav|一刀,并且活了下来。该说是堪称伟业的经历了吧。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_67.wav|虽然对我来说,她是真正的神明
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_68.wav|可以更改稻妻的命运
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_69.wav|但是如果是和你起了冲突的话,我一定会站在你这一边的。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_70.wav|八重宫司大人的合作向来很愉快
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_71.wav|看,操辦節慶慶典非常勞神費力,營收多半也不好看。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_72.wav|八重宫司大人操办的产业,真的既风雅又有收成。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_73.wav|作為神里家的家主,兄長平日需要出面諸多場合。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_74.wav|我雖盡力分擔兄長肩上所負擔的責任,卻也無法緩和他常年積壓在身的疲倦。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_75.wav|唉,就当是为了妹妹着想,希望你能劝言,让兄长多多注意身体啊。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_76.wav|節慶慶典是社奉行和巫女众的責任
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_77.wav|那位煙火專家,也的確能讓氣氛熱烈起來。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_78.wav|合作多了,因而漸漸熟絡
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_79.wav|治安和消防問題嗎?我們也會一併納入預先規劃的
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_80.wav|這些原因而看不到烟花,才會讓人們心中留下缺憾吧。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_81.wav|你的请求,对我来说很特别呢既然把你当作朋友,我也应坦诚以待
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_82.wav|不过,事关神里家的秘密,还希望你能守口如瓶。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_83.wav|神力家因為沒能保護好國寶級別的刀工,遭受了不小的衝擊。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_84.wav|愚人众阴谋算计我们折损了诸多臣下受到许多责罚
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_85.wav|甚至因之早衰神里家在幕府中的地位也一落千丈
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_86.wav|好在兄長繼任後力挽狂瀾
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_87.wav|家門雖已復興,社奉行一系也上下齐心,但大事要事方面仍靠兄長定奪。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_88.wav|将军所传的断刀之术,也因星象、用途、矿质、炉火环境、人之性格、元素变化的不同而有所区分
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_89.wav|是刀工之间所说的雷电五传
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_90.wav|造名刀的刀工,也被算作是本領通神的神事相關人員,歸屬統籌文化、藝術、祭祀的社奉行一派管理。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_91.wav|出現了刀工背叛的事情,自然就是神里家的督办不力了。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_92.wav|對我來說,母親是意義非凡的存在。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_93.wav|端庄,优雅,无论遇到怎样的局面,都会露出沉静的笑容,以从容不迫的态度,操持着神里家大大小小的事物。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_94.wav|母亲是完美的化身也不為過
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_95.wav|但自从她离世的那一刻起,我就深切地意识到,我已经不是那个可以躲在母亲身后的小绫华了。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_96.wav|下来要说的话,可能不太符合稻妻幕府社奉行神里家的身份
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_97.wav|不过,就我的判断,你应该能容许我小小的任性吧
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_98.wav|稍微有点累了,可以让我靠一下你的肩膀吗?
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_99.wav|就好
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_100.wav|我都很喜欢雅悦诗词棋艺与舞蹈你也感兴趣吗?
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_102.wav|……是啊,只要生活在這個世界上,就難免遇到種種不如意的事情。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_103.wav|但如果是因為自己的事情,就讓周遭的人擔心的話……
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_104.wav|果然,我還是不能說。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_105.wav|坦率,真的是一件很难的事情
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_106.wav|我必须不断告诫自己是神里家的大小姐,在无数双眼睛、无数人的期盼之下摆出完美无缺的姿态
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_107.wav|这样的我,是否也该追求自己的愿望呢?
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_108.wav|是否也該…讓你理解我的心意呢?
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_109.wav|我对异国料理很有兴趣,虽然很少有尝试的机会。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_110.wav|如果是要局限在稻妻料理內的話,應該是茶泡飯吧。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_111.wav|不能給一般客人看見
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_112.wav|我也是偷偷告訴你的
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_113.wav|虽然不是不能吃,但我对动物脂肪或内脏…大概会有点…
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_114.wav|请随我来,只要走一小段路,不会耽搁你太长时间的。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_115.wav|打听到你的生日之后,我就提前了一段时间开始筹备。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_116.wav|比起名贵的礼物,我妄自猜测,或许这样的礼物会更合我们的情谊?
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_117.wav|此次,就請讓我以扇舞為禮吧。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_118.wav|失禮了
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_119.wav|感謝,與你切磋使我收益良多,相信在劍術上也能更進一步。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_120.wav|多亏你的点拨
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_121.wav|我對自己的能力也理解得更透彻了。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_122.wav|更加游刃有余了
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_123.wav|社奉行事物之餘,甚至有空嘗試一些新的事情。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_124.wav|要来试试最近学做的点心吗?
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_125.wav|尝有所思,斯世如磐。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_126.wav|熟料浮世事,留驻難。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_127.wav|抱歉,明明是值得高兴的时候,我却想起了那么悲伤的时刻……
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_128.wav|相處的時間過於畅怀,竟然讓我害怕再次失去
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_129.wav|是…失態了呀
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_130.wav|起舞吧,失禮了
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_132.wav|神里流 霜灭
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_133.wav|珍觅奇,也算得一種雅趣
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_134.wav|今日运势不错,我会珍惜这一份幸运,不容小觑呢。
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_135.wav|久违的对手,该决断了
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_136.wav|失态了,我还有未竟之事,让家族蒙羞了
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_137.wav|的家伙…怎么会…
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_138.wav|神里绫华
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_140.wav|请赐教
./custom_character_voice/character/processed_141.wav|請多關照
